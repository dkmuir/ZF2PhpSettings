Copy config/module.zf2_php_settings.local.php.dist to ./configs/autoload without the .dist extension

Populate it with php.ini options and values http://uk.php.net/manual/en/ini.list.php

Some options are not configurable at runtime

Also you'll need to add "ZF2PhpSettings" to your application.config.php
